# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project involved successfully transforming raw crowdfunding data from Excel into structured CSV files for PostgreSQL. Utilizing Pandas, the data was thoroughly cleaned, normalized, and organized into tables for efficient database integration. The analysis focused on campaign outcomes and category trends, recognizing the limitations of a short timeframe (2020-2023) and narrow geographic coverage (7 countries). Future efforts will center on refining the data pipeline, expanding data collection, and broadening the dataset to enhance insights into crowdfunding trends and outcomes globally.
